The DARRTS system is one of the applications that comprise the DARRTS Program (DARRTS, DRBI, LX and EES). DARRTS, to date, has replaced most of CDER's legacy systems that support the receipt, tracking, management, and reporting of information about clinical investigation and market submissions for human drugs and therapeutics biologics. There are 15 remaining legacy applications that are being maintained through the LX and EES projects. Upon completion of each major release of DARRTS, the application will progressively improve the FDA's ability to provide reports to Congress on a number of issues, including meeting performance goals related to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This web-based system will continue to be a major advancement in terms of flexibility, integration, and meeting the Agency and CDER's business requirements.",

Findings indicate that complicated births and hospital discharges within 30 days of birth remained relatively constant, but average costs per discharge increased substantially. Most strikingly, over time, the proportion of complicated births billed to Medicaid increased, while the proportion paid for by private payers decreased. Complications for infants with Medicaid were more likely due to preterm birth-low birth weight and respiratory distress, while complications for those with private insurance were more likely due to jaundice. Policies to prevent common birth complications have the potential to reduce costs for public programs and improve birth outcomes.</p>\n",

In early 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released safety warnings about ESA use in non-MDS cancer patients. In August 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services restricted the coverage of ESAs for Medicare non-MDS cancer patients. Researchers report in Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions on Off-Label Use in Myelodysplastic Syndromes, published in Volume 4, Issue 4 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, that the FDA and CMS policies unintentionally lowered ESA use in Medicare MDS patients by 7.9 percent by the first half of 2008. The policies did not conclusively improve the appropriateness of ESA use, as concordance with two out of the three treatment guidelines that were examined worsened by the first half of 2008.</p>\n",

These conditions including severe pressure ulcers, fractures, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, vascular catheter-associated infections, surgical site infections following certain spinal, shoulder, or elbow procedures, and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following hip or knee replacements could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines.

This study used a Pew Charitable Trust survey of a nationally representative, random sample of 3,014 adult U.S. residents to examine their use of the Internet and mHealth (mobile health) technologies across insurance types. The report finds that most self-reported Internet users seek health information and privately insured respondents (compared with other insurance types) are more likely to use new technologies. Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to share health information online and Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to text with health professionals. Future increases in out-of-pocket medical costs may drive consumers toward these generally free electronic health tools.</p>\n",

Many private insurers implemented similar non-payment policies. Financial impact of the policy to hospitals and insurers was viewed as minimal because of the low rate of HACs, but patient advocates noted that calculations do not account for downstream costs of HACs to CMS and taxpayers. Hospital staff remained concerned that documentation issues distracted staff from patient care. Because patients are unaware of the HAC-POA policy, unintended consequences to patients cannot be fully assessed at this time.</p>\n",

Prior to the taxonomy, only aggregate state-level HCBS expenditure data were available, however, policy initiatives to expand HCBS use among Medicaid beneficiaries who use long-term services and supports (LTSS) have created a need for more detailed analyses of HCBS use and spending. Authors of The HCBS Taxonomy - A New Language for Classifying Home- and Community-Based Services, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, demonstrate how applying the HCBS taxonomy to claims available in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data allows for detailed analysis of HCBS spending and service at the state, service, and person levels. Researchers found that 28 states spent almost 23.6 billion dollars on HCBS in 2008. Roughly, 80 percent of expenditures were categorized as round-the-clock, home-based, and day services. Other services, such as case management, or equipment, modifications, and technology were widely used, but were not particularly costly and did not account for a large proportion of expenditures in every state.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>Medicaid pays for about half the births in the United States, at very high cost. Compared to usual obstetrical care, care by midwives at a birth center could reduce costs to the Medicaid program, according to Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based at a Freestanding Birth Center, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review. This study draws on information from a previous study of the maternal and infant outcomes of birth center care to determine whether such care reduces Medicaid costs for low income women. Costs to Medicaid are derived from birth center data and from other national sources of the cost of obstetrical care. The authors estimate that birth center care could save an average of 1,164 dollars per birth (2008 constant dollars), or 11.6 million dollars per 10,000 births per year. As Medicaid faces continuing cost increases and budget constraints, policy makers may want to consider a larger role for midwives and birth centers in maternity care for low-risk Medicaid pregnant women.</p>\n",

Using data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries across U.S. geographic healthcare markets (hospital referral regions, HRRs), data from federally funded health centers, and income data from the American Community Survey,  the authors calculated Medicare spending and clinical quality, and compared those outcomes in HRRs with high versus low health center penetration. HRRs with high penetration by health centers had 9.7 percent lower Medicare spending (926 dollars per person) than HRRs with low health center penetration, and no difference in clinical quality outcomes.

    "description" : "<p>The Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) facilitates finding and comparing neuroimaging resources for functional and structural neuroimaging analyses—including popular tools as well as those that once might have been hidden in another researcher's laboratory or some obscure corner of cyberspace. NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can compare tools on NITRC and developers can seek and receive help from the community to make their tools more usable and accessible.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.</p>\n\n<p>The data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).</p>\n\n<p>N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.</p>\n\n<p>The N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) is an administrative data system providing descriptive information about the national flow of admissions to providers of substance abuse treatment. The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.</p>\n\n<p>The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.</p>\n\n<p>The TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states. Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.</p>\n\n<p>TEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>\n",

A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.</p>\n\n<p>DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.</p>\n",

Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. Insurance Component Summary Tables \nThe Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected. \nMEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November. National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors.

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.</p>\n",

BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence of lung transplants in the Medicare population in recent years to aid researchers who develop CED studies of ECP for BOS in determining sample size estimates.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services. The Competitive Acquisition Omburdsmans (CAOs) role is to help ensure that inquiries and complaints about the Program are resolved. As an ombudsman, the CAO also works with other areas of CMS to identify potential systemic issues with the goal of helping CMS ensure that beneficiaries have access to and suppliers provide high-quality DMEPOS items and services. The CAO also provides an annual report to Congress. In order to protect the interests of potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has been conducting real-time claims analysis to monitor health status for groups of Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Health status results are shown in the files on this site. Each file includes a written summary of results and graphical displays of key indicators reflective of the health status of beneficiaries and their access to DMEPOS items and services. The data is derived from claims for Medicare populations in each CBA and a corresponding comparator region that is similar to the CBA.</p>\n",

The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces. Copies of the current survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese, are available on this page. QHP Enrollee Survey reports will be available in 2015.</p>\n",

Medical specialists and primary care providers were most likely to submit a PQRS report, most frequently e-prescribing, electronic health records, and process quality measures. Reporting providers were involved with 17 percent of the beneficiarys NH-EM visits in 2009 compared to fifty percent for the provider of the plurality of NH-EM visits. PQRS reporting alone cannot solve the inherent attribution problem in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but as participation increases, it could help improve both attribution and information about the quality of health care services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>\n",

Producing always enrolled estimates (with standard MCBS ATC weights) and ever enrolled estimates (with weight adjustments) would provide users with more reporting capabilities since the always enrolled files do not capture individuals who died or gained-lost Medicare entitlement during the year. This study elaborates on differences in estimates and how MCBS sampling and data processing dictate the need for special weights. Alternative weighting schemes were compared using estimates from different approaches and with CMS administrative data counts where applicable. Since the differences observed were generally modest, it was concluded on the basis of other factors (such as ease of use, operational simplicity, and methodological soundness) that weights using Ratio Raking adjustments provide a reasonable alternative to traditional ATC survey weights.</p>\n",

In Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Beneficiaries, A National Picture, the authors developed the MD-PPAS database, in which they identified hospitalists as physicians trained in primary care who billed at least 90 percent of their total charges in a year for Medicare in inpatient settings. Their findings, published in Volume 4, Issue 2 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, show that hospitalists made up 4.4 percent of all physicians serving Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 and 13.3 percent of primary care physicians. Over a quarter of Medicare admissions had a hospitalist as the attending physician, though the rate was much higher for medical than surgical admissions (32 percent versus 11 percent). Between 2009 and 2011, medical admissions with a hospitalist attending increased from 26 percent to 32 percent. The ability to identify hospitalists from claims data will help research on the impact of hospitalist use on quality and cost.</p>\n",

The authors compared metrics of reporting completeness and quality for BHOs to similar metrics for six states that primarily cover Mental Health and Substance Abuse services on a FFS basis. Of the 15 states reporting enrollment in BHO plans in 2009, four states submitted encounter data in the inpatient (IP) file. The IP data from these four states were judged usable for research. Encounter data in the other (OT) file were available for five states, but only two states had data assessed as complete.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.</p>\n",

The study followed 34,400 enrollees in the Alabama Childrens Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids, whose copayment increased in fiscal year 2004, and compared their patterns of prescription drug spending before and after the increase. The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants. Children with chronic conditions were less responsive to the copayment increase. There was no evidence of concurrent increases in other medical expenditures, which might have been due to less prescription drug utilization. This suggests that increasing copayments may help control Program costs.</p>\n",

The population examined, people 65 years and older with chronic illnesses, have an overall awareness of 13 percent, similar to the general population. Age, race, education, and self-reported health status are associated with greater awareness of physician quality information (PQI), as are trust in the Internet as a source of health care information and not trusting ones physician as an information source. Population trends over time will not likely improve awareness, nor will increases in patient activation or satisfaction with care-both goals of recent Medicare initiatives. The need for devoting resources to stronger efforts that would raise awareness of PQI across all Medicare beneficiaries requires a clearer understanding of the level of beneficiary awareness needed to achieve the ultimate goal for transparent PQI, which is better quality of care for consumers.</p>\n",

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.</p>\n\n<p>Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.  Note that the axis scale for TBI-related deaths appears to the right of the chart and differs from TBI-related hospitalizations and ED visits.</p>\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html\">http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html</a> to view more TBI data &amp; statistics.</p>\n",

Costs were almost 6,000 dollars higher for those who accessed peer support services, mostly for professional services and prescription drugs. While the use of Medicaid peer support may not result in savings from fewer costly crisis stabilizations and psychiatric hospitalizations, it does support the principles of self-direction and recovery. State policy makers must weigh the potential higher cost of peer support programs with efforts to change the delivery of mental health services.</p>\n",

Using Cost Reports and the Home Health Compare (HHC) quality report card 2010 data, they estimated the relationships between total costs, the type of patients served by the agency, its quality of care, and its market environment. They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services. Despite its limitations, this study offers new insights into home-care agencies costs in the Prospective Payment System and HHC era.</p>\n",

The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March/April 2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially during an economic downturn.</p>\n",

The results of these analyses of PAC use vary based on 1) the denominator used to calculate an average payment level-all hospital discharges or solely PAC users 2) the mix and volume of PAC services, including decisions to include or exclude an acute hospital readmission and 3) the definition of the end point of an episode. The differences in PAC episode payments by geographic area show the geographic variation in the percent of beneficiaries discharged to PAC and the state variation in mean payment per PAC user. The results of these analyses provide information on the makeup of service use under different episode definitions and highlight considerations for providers and payers testing alternatives for bundled payment.</p>\n",

Using data from 2007 to 2009, the study examined potentially avoidable hospitalizations rates by setting, state, and medical condition, and the average cost of these events. Beneficiaries in institutions were much more likely to have these events - 16 percent of beneficiaries in the study population were in an institution, yet comprised 45 percent of all potentially avoidable hospitalizations. The range in rates per 1,000 person years across the states was considerable from a low of 59 (Utah) to a high of 197 (Mississippi), a more than a threefold difference. Five conditions were responsible for nearly 80 percent of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. From 2007 to 2009, the national and state rates were fairly consistent.</p>\n",

Due largely to generic substitution, average prescription cost only grew by 4 percent during this period, although the average drug price rose by twice that amount. The analysis demonstrated that tiered copayments and other benefit management practices were effective at encouraging shifts to less costly drugs. The study also found that less competitive drug classes (defined as having limited availability of generics or limited therapeutic substitution) had larger price increases than more competitive classes (those with well established or emerging generic substitutes).</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The HRSA Data Warehouse (HDW) serves as the official enterprise repository for all data related to HRSA programs, grants and activities. The HDW provides both raw data sets as well as an array of visual and interactive tools for searching, accessing, viewing and displaying a broad range of HRSA programmatic information, related health resources, geographic data and demographic data. The HDW promotes information sharing and collaboration among HRSA staff, HRSA partners, grantees, care providers, health planners and policy makers and other audiences interested in HRSA's public health services and information. The current version of the HDW includes data from the following HRSA Bureaus and Offices: BCRS, BHPR, BPHC, HAB, MCHB, OA, OPAE, ORHP and OSHA, with additional Bureau and Office data added and updated on an ongoing basis. The HDW provides quick access to information that includes: - Find A Health Center - with search-by-address capabilities, maps and driving directions; - Identify HRSA Grants by Key Program Area or State; - Locate Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by address; - Identify HPSAs Eligible for Medicare Physician Bonus Payment; - Locate Medically Underserved Areas and Population (MUA/P) groups by address. In addition, the HDW provides the ability to explore data and maps that include: - Reports - traditional text-based reporting of the data is available in the HDW. Users can select, sort, export and view the data either by spreadsheet or preformatted reports; - Maps - visually explore the HRSA-specific information, health resources and demographic data in geographic relation to one another; - Map Data Services - utilize data from the HDW to create custom maps and incorporate your own data; and - Downloads - ability to download data on Health Professional Shortage Areas, Primary Care Service Areas, and National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The HDW data content and functionality are continually evolving so a What's New page is made available. The data is refreshed continually and most data are updated on a daily basis. Please see the Data Refresh Dates section of the website for more information. The HDW is designed to provide extensive tabular and spatial information available on HRSA-supported programs and related health resources. To do this, the warehouse combines data from various federal sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and various HRSA programs. For more information about where the data in the data warehouse comes from, see the Data Sources section of the website.</p>\n",

Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''Âµg/m''Â³), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''Âµg/m''Â³)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The Daily Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are geographically aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor air, spanning the years 2003-2008. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''Âµg/m''Â³), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''Âµg/m''Â³)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.</p>\n",

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.</p>\n\n<p>The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).</p>\n\n<p>Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.</p>\n\n<p>The NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>\n",

These estimates result from \"bridging\" the 31 race categories used in Census 2000, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards (Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, White). Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999.  Obtain population counts by  Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year or 5-year groups).   The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''¢ Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''¢ Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''¢ Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''¢ Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''¢ Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.</p>\n",

The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.

The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\". Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View additional information for indicator definitions and documentation by selecting Content Area \"Air Quality\" and the respective indicator at the following website: <a href=\"http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action\">http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action</a></p>\n",

    "description" : "<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>\n\n<p>DDOD use case to request means on consolidating multiple data sources (MDR, PMA, 510(k), R&amp;L) in order to build a list of all marketed medical devices.</p>\n\n<p><b>WHAT IS A USE CASE?</b></p>\n\n<p>A “Use Case” is a request that was made by the user community because there were no available datasets that met their particular needs.  If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of a use case falls within the <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us \">Demand-Driven Open Data</a> (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.</p>\n\n<p>Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.</p>\n\n<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>\n\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has multiple data sources for registered medical devices, including <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm\">Medical Device Reporting (MDR)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Medicaldevices/Deviceregulationandguidance/Howtomarketyourdevice/Premarketsubmissions/Premarketapprovalpma/Default.Htm\">Premarket Approval (PMA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/510kClearances/\">510(k)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfrl/rl.cfm\">Establishment Registration and Device Listing (R&amp;L)</a>.  There are a number of challenges associated with the data, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>A single marketed product often has multiple 510(k)s</li>\n  <li>A PMA might represent multiple marketed products over the course of the evolution of the device</li>\n  <li>510(k) and PMA downloads only include class II and III devices, omitting class I</li>\n</ul><p>The only current way to consolidate the information across these various databases in a reliable manner is via FOIA request.  There have already been multiple requests for this data at regular refresh intervals.</p>\n\n<p><b>VALUE</b></p>\n\n<p>A single source for all registered medical devices is needed for core services on medical device insights provided to hospitals.  In addition, without a single source of data, it is difficult for hospitals to understand the available substitutes for a given device.</p>\n\n<p><b>USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; SOLUTION</b></p>\n\n<p>Information about this use cases is maintained in a wiki: <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_5:_Consolidated_registry_of_marketed_medical_devices\">http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_5:_Consolidated_registry_of_marketed_me...</a></p>\n\n<p>It serves as a knowledge base.</p>\n\n<p><b>USE CASE DISCUSSION FORUM</b></p>\n\n<p>All communications between Data Users, DDOD Administrators and Data Owners are logged as discussions within GitHub issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/5\">https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/5</a></p>\n\n<p>It aims to provide complete transparency into the process and ensure the same message gets to all participants.</p>\n\n<p><b>CASE STATUS</b></p>\n\n<p>Closed via openFDA.gov API, which includes medical device registration and listing as of September 2015.</p>\n",

The authors analyses of Medicare claims data from 2009 and 2010 show that 54 percent of claims with a secondary diagnosis code of a pressure ulcer site did not have any pressure ulcer stage code (compared to only 10 percent of claims with a pressure ulcer as a primary diagnosis). On average, underreporting of stage codes occurred more often in hospitals classified as academic medical centers, larger, urban, or not-for-profit. The combination of capturing 25 diagnosis codes under the new 5010 claim format and the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 will likely reduce some of the underreporting of the stages for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.</p>\n",

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients. Ultimately, increasing controller medication use in these patients would lead to improved ratios and fewer emergent healthcare visits.</p>\n",

Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care. The comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs. In some cases, it will be socially desirable to expand telehealth services, but only in cases where the value of emergency access or reduced patient travel time outweighs the additional cost of delivering care via telehealth.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>Modeling Per Capita State Health Expenditure Variation State-Level Characteristics Matter, published in Volume 3, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, focuses on average spending in personal health care per capita at the state level for all payers. In contrast to this work, most of the prior research on geographic variation in health spending focused on health spending for Medicare enrollees, at a sub-state or individual level. This paper shows that state-level income, health care capacity, and the share of elderly residents are the most important factors in explaining variation in personal health care spending per capita among states over time. Because the slow-moving nature of health spending per capita and close relationships among state-level factors create inefficiencies in modeling this variation, multiple modeling strategies were utilized to obtain more robust interpretations of the overall results.</p>\n",

The interviews reveal important policy findings. First, these changes in Medicaid built upon pre-existing state-funded health insurance programs for the poor,  second, cost and enrollment predictions were challenging, indicating the uncertainty in such projections for 2014, other lessons included a substantial need for behavioral health services in this population, and the administrative challenges of expanding coverage, and finally, the researchers learned how political context - support or opposition from stakeholders and the general public - plays a critical role in shaping the success of Medicaid expansions.</p>\n",

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control.

    "description" : "<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) relies heavily on the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to cover uninsured populations. In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.</p>\n",

While leaders described efforts to improve overall quality as driven by standardized metrics, this did not hold for efforts to reduce disparities. Data were frequently only examined by race and ethnicity when overall performance on a measure was low. Disparities were attributed to either individual choices or to cultural and linguistic factors, with plans focusing interventions on recently immigrated groups, despite trends in HEDIS measures that often did not support this focus.</p>\n",

The goal is to help State officials and their public- and private-sector partners better understand health care quality and disparities in their State. State-level information used to create the State Snapshots is based on data collected for the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR). The State Snapshots include summary measures of quality of care and States' performances relative to all States, the region, and best performing States by overall health care quality, types of care (preventive, acute, and chronic), settings of care (hospitals, ambulatory care, nursing home, and home health), and clinical conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, maternal and child health, and respiratory diseases). Special focus areas on diabetes, asthma, Healthy People 2010, clinical preventive services, disparities, payer, and variation over time are also featured. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has released the State Snapshots each year in conjunction with the 2004 NHQR through the 2009 NHQR.</p>\n",

It is intended to help analysts and people who would like to analyze these data. The Survey has been conducted approximately every four years since 1977. For each survey year, HRSA has prepared two Public Use File databases in flat ASCII file format, without delimiters. The 2008 data are also offerred in SAS and SPSS formats. Information likely to point to an individual in a sparsely-populated county has been withheld. General Public Use Files are State-based and provide information on nurses without identifying the County and Metropolitan Area in which they live or work.  County Public Use Files provide most, but not all, the same information on the nurse from the General Public Use File, and also identifies the County and Metropolitan Areas in which the nurses live or work. NSSRN data are to be used for research purposes only and may not be used in any manner to identify individual respondents.</p>\n",

It also provides facility and release details, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and aggregates release data over multiple years. Maps also show locations of Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, listing all chemical contaminants present at these sites.  Two versions of TOXMAP are available: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004, and a new version of TOXMAP based on Adobe® Flash/Flex technology.  The new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities and additional datasets such as EPA coal plant emissions data and U.S. commercial nuclear power plants.</p>\n",

Brief descriptions for the code ranges and modifiers are provided in the readme file. The data set name contains the year followed by a five character sequence that is the HCPC CPT code. This HCPC CPT code corresponds to the first HCPC CPT in the selected code range of disciplines. Within each code range are, procedural, condition, or description subheadings. Each data set displays the allowed services, allowed charges, and payment amounts by HCPC CPT codes and prominent modifiers. These reports will only illustrate the modifiers where duplicative claim submissions occur. This is to avoid duplicate counting of services. Utilization for modifiers not affected by duplicative counting are collapsed into the Other category on the reports. Therefore, not all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published modifiers are illustrated. The file is updated annually and usually available by September for the previous year.</p>\n",

The World Health Organization, CDC, and the Canadian Public Health Association, developed the GHPSS to collect data on tobacco use and cessation counseling among health professional students in all WHO member states. GHPSS is a standardized school-based survey of third-year students pursuing advanced degrees in dentistry, medicine, nursing, or pharmacy. It is conducted in schools during regular class sessions. GHPSS follows an anonymous, self-administered format for data collection. GHPSS uses a core questionnaire on demographics, prevalence of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, desire for smoking cessation, and training received regarding patient counseling on smoking cessation techniques. Questionnaires are translated into local languages as needed. GHPSS has a standardized methodology for selecting participating schools and classes and uniform data processing procedures.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the principal source of information on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States and is one of the major data collection programs of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p>\n",

While relatively few adults in Idaho received a wellness exam after such coverage was added, the adoption of managed care for dental services was associated with increased receipt of dental care, including preventive care. New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions.</p>\n",

A 10-percent increase in reporting, the equivalent to reporting one more indicator per agency, increased the probability of a home health agency leaving an area with less-educated people by 0.3 percentage points, compared with leaving an area with high education. This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program.

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.</p>\n",

This burden is especially higher in rural areas, which are known to report higher cancer frequency and death rate. Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources. Non-participant states in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program can build similar powerful datasets to target cancer disparities.</p>\n",

In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.</p>\n\n<p>In that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent.

Disenrollees incurred 1,021 dollars per month in Medicare payments following disenrollment to FFS in 2007, which was 28 percent higher than predicted based on risk scores used to set MA payment rates. Differences between actual and predicted payments were smaller for disenrollees of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans than for Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), indicating less biased disenrollment from PPOs and PFFS plans. Analysis of 10 individual MA plans revealed considerable variation in the degree of biased disenrollment. These findings raise concerns about care experiences among sicker enrollees and increased costs to Medicare.</p>\n",

The study analyzed administrative data linked with cancer registry data to estimate cost of care for beneficiaries with cardiac disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The cost increases ranged from 4,385 dollars for cardiac disease to 11,009 dollars for mental health disorders.

The expert panel projects that 65 percent of primary care physicians in large group practices, 45 percent of primary care physicians in small group practices, and 44 percent of all other specialists could achieve the meaningful use of certified EHR technology by 2015. The expert panel also predicts that meaningful use rates could increase to 80 percent, 65 percent, and 66 percent in 2019 for these three groups, respectively. The information from this study is particularly valuable due to a high degree of uncertainty in a new policy environment and could help inform and evaluate CMS and ONC programs.</p>\n",

Researchers selected four states to conduct an in-depth review of their reporting systems and uses of the data California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Pennsylvania and found that all four have innovative approaches in using these data to promote patient safety initiatives and publicly report facility-level rates. State selections of adverse events to report were at least partially influenced by Medicares list of hospital acquired conditions (HACs) for nonpayment. Federal initiatives have bolstered HAC reporting activity at the state level, yet there is still wide variability and lack of standardization. The authors recommend that more work and research is needed to develop a national reporting system template that has standard definitions, methodology, and reporting.</p>\n",

For more information on the fields in the NADAC weekly file, please see the NADAC Data Field Definitions.  In addition, to easily identify and understand the pricing changes that occur each week, we are posting a NADAC week to week file comparison, called the NADAC Weekly Comparison, to accompany the weekly NADAC file.  This comparison file identifies the drug products with current NADAC rates that are replaced with new NADAC rates.  Other changes (e.g. NDC additions and terminations) to the NADAC file are not reflected in this comparison.  The explanation of the data fields used in the weekly comparison file are further defined in the NADAC Week to Week Data Field Definitions.</p>\n",

    "description" : "<p>The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.</p>\n",

The Skilled Nursing Facility PUF contains information on utilization, payment (allowed amount, Medicare payment and standard payment), and submitted charges organized by CMS Certification Number (6-digit provider identification number), Resource Utilization Group (RUG), and state of service.  This PUF is based on information from CMSs Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) data files. The data in the Skilled Nursing Facility PUF covers calendar year 2013 and contains 100 percent final-action (i.e., all claim adjustments have been resolved) skilled nursing facility institutional claims for the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) population.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Skilled Nursing Facility PUF has a wealth of payment and utilization information about skilled nursing facility services, the dataset also has a number of limitations.  The information presented in this file does not indicate the quality of care provided by individual skilled nursing facilities.  The file only contains cost and utilization information.  Additionally, the data are not risk adjusted and thus do not account for differences in the underlying severity of disease of patient populations treated by providers.  For additional limitations, please review the methodology document available below.</p>\n",

The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitals’ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.  These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). CMS uses the information on this webpage to calculate a hospital’s MSPB Measure value, which is reported on Hospital Compare. Specifically, the MSPB Measure methodology risk-adjusts the values on this webpage to account for beneficiary age and severity of illness. This webpage provides the pre-risk-adjusted values to help the public understand the MSPB Measure and its composition.</p>\n",
